# mrbmacs

mrbmacs is a lightweight text editor with an Emacs-like interface.
It adopts the Scintilla framework for efficient code editing and enhanced syntax highlighting, augmented by the customizability of mruby scripting extensions.

Mrbmacs has the ability to operate across different UI frameworks, allowing you to choose the interface that aligns with your preferences.
Currently, it supports Termbox, Curses and GTK.
